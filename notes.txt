- support doubles in paths
- refactor recursive descent parser for operators
- consider removing Type completely
- review how to handle For type
- change For: Operator plus Limit and Increment defaults to 1
- revisit conversion, specifically we should not silently allow conversions to fail
-----------------------
- add special call declaration mode for paths, e.g. $foo($a,$b) declares functions foo with params a and b
- fix accidental auto-evaluation of langauge elements
- rename MarkupObject to ResourceObject, etc.
- clean up MarkupConverter names, especially LoadActions, etc.
- convert Type arguments to type or expression
-----------------------
- provide special handling for context across function calls
- add types to function parameters, and report them at call time
- add way to apply Call to a collection
- consider styles and collections
- handle detaching
- add MarkupMultiConverter
- finish MarkupCollection cleanup
- add timer
- add RoutedEventTrigger
- use to intentionally avoid documentation: /// <internalonly />
- support multiple indexers in paths
-----------------------
- ToString with details for a composite object doesn't refresh its binding properly
- delay evaluation of MarkupObject properties until parent inheritance context is set
- figure out why MarkupObjectExtension cannot be first item in Resources
- figure out why ExpressionCollection cannot be cast to an IEnumerable<IExpression>
