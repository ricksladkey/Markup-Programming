- Operation.Attach
- rename namespace
- find alternative to BackTrace, e.g. an entire engine debug proxy
- handle Call.Parameter for function calls
- write macro to format comment region
- write macro to remove unused usings
- rename MarkupObject to ResourceObject, etc.
- rewrite EventTrigger: the current one silent fails if the event name doesn't exist
- review how to handle For type
- change For: Operator plus Limit and Increment defaults to 1
- add types to function parameters, and report them at call time
- support multiple indexers in paths
- support parameters for path indexers
- add error checking to Path operators
- provide special handling for context across function calls
- discover and store ResourceObject upon first execution
- add way to apply Call to a collection
- remove try/catch from Call
- clean up MarkupConverter names, especially LoadActions, etc.
- clean up DebugWriteLine and ShowMessageBox
- add string operators
- finish MarkupCollection cleanup
- figure out why MarkupObjectExtension cannot be first item in Resources
- figure out why ExpressionCollection cannot be cast to an IEnumerable<IExpression>

- use to intentionally avoid documentation: /// <internalonly />

- add modules as a static dictionary for function lookup
- add timer
- add RoutedEventTrigger
- add MarkupMultiConverter
- Set: validate that Target is set (with unit test)
- Set: validate that Target has a two-way binding if PropertyName is omitted (with unit test)
- Set: support dotted property paths
- convert Type arguments to type or expression
- delay evaluation of MarkupObject properties until parent inheritance context is set

- statement collections should be read-only
- all collections should be read-only
- handle detaching

- optionally show exceptions in message boxes
- convert message box to an expression
- add InputBox expression
- add Path to complement Binding in Set
- check into source control
- extend Property and StaticProperty operators to support paths

- read local DP value: this.ReadLocalValue(dependencyProperty) == DependencyProperty.UnsetValue
- Add ToString for MarkupObject
- ToString with details for a composite object doesn't refresh its binding properly
- why does p:Handler work with CLR event only as long as they aren't FrameworkElements
- consider not changing associated object in TemplatePart and VisualTree
