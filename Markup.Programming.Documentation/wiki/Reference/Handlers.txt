!! Handlers
Markup programming provides several core handlers.  Handlers are active operations that "do something" of their own accord simply by being attached to another object.  The most popular handler operation is [EventHandler] but in situations where markup programming is being used to bind view operations to a view-model the workhorse operation might be [CallHandler].  The [CallHandler] operation is a special form of syntactic sugar that combines [EventHandler] and [Call].
