!!! CallHandler

The *CallHandler* operation creates an association between the object it is attached to and the a method or function by using the [Path] supplied.   It is a form of syntactic sugar for a very common usage of a call inside an event handler.  Specifically:

{code:html}
    <p:CallHandler Path="EventPath => CallPath" Property1 Property2 Property3/>
{code:html}

means exactly the same as:

{code:html}
    <p:EventHandler Path="EventPath">
        <p:Call Path="CallPath"  Property1 Property2 Property3/>
    </p:EventHandler>
{code:html}

only it is more concise.

In other words, see [EventHandler] and [Call] for further details.
