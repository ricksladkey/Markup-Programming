!!!! Content Property

Most markup programming elements have a property marked with the {{ContentProperty}} attribute.  This property is the property that you can supply as the default content of the element when it is not a defined using a self-closing tag.  For example, the [Return] statement has a Value property that is its content property.  As a result, the following three statements are all syntactically legal and identical:

{code:html}
<p:Return Value="True"/>
                    
<p:Return>
    <p:Return.Value>
        True
    </p:Return.Value>
</p:Return>
                    
<p:Return>
    True
</p:Return>
{code:html}
