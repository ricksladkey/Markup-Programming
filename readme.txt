! Markup Programming

* _Markup Programming is a standalone extension to XAML that provides operation-binding power comparable to the data-binding built in to XAML.  It is is built on the foundation of a complete imperative programming language with dynamic objects._

Why add rich support for operation-binding to XAML?  People used to ask the same question about data-binding.  The answer is that the combination of powerful operation-binding and data-binding enables the use of elegant, maintainable and sophisticated design methodologies such as MVVM.
