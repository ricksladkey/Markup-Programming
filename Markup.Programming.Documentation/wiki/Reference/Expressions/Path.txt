!!!! Description
Evaluates the specified path expression {{Expr}}.  Since {{Expr}} is the content property this component allows the path to be specified as the inner text using the following syntax:
{code:html}
<p:Path>path-expression</p:Path>
{code:html}
Note: do not surround the text with quotes when using this syntax.  As a result, you may also use double-quotes for strings more easily.
