- System.Windows might or might not be loaded during unit tests: how to address?
- allow context to be set from scripting
- be careful about empty expressions defaulting to context
- true, false, and null don't need to use @syntax
- eliminate PropertyInitializerNode
- consider how to call extension methods
- add block (aka inline function)
- test designer errors, e.g. syntax error in script
- clean up event/path interaction
- add support for multiple indexers in path expression

- Parse number dot identifier as an integer
- Add support for dynamic objects in path expressions
- write converter sample
- add Attached event to all components
- auto-increment version number
- detect handler re-registration
- refactor recursive descent parser for operators
- consider removing Type completely
- review how to handle For type
- change For: Operator plus Limit and Increment defaults to 1
- revisit conversion, specifically we should not silently allow conversions to fail
-----------------------
- fix accidental auto-evaluation of langauge elements
- clean up ResourceConverter names, especially LoadActions, etc.
- convert Type arguments to type or expression
-----------------------
- provide special handling for context across function calls
- add types to function parameters, and report them at call time
- add way to apply Call to a collection
- consider styles and collections
- handle detaching
- add MarkupMultiConverter
- add timer
- add RoutedEventTrigger
- use to intentionally avoid documentation: /// <internalonly />
- support multiple indexers in paths
-----------------------
- ToString with details for a composite object doesn't refresh its binding properly
- delay evaluation of MarkupObject properties until parent inheritance context is set
- figure out why MarkupObjectExtension cannot be first item in Resources
- figure out why ExpressionCollection cannot be cast to an IEnumerable<IExpression>
